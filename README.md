# Binary Classifcation to predict productivity within industry

This repository has a few scripts, one is with Scikit-Learn, another is binary classication from scratch(no library) and the next is Scikit learn optimised with **genetic algorithm**.
# Process
The idea is to predict whether a productive work day is over the threshold of 75% or not. The scripts contain a range of data science techniques such as Data Normalisation, transposing etc, as
well as displaying my fundemental knowledge of machine learning, binary classication, and optimisation.
